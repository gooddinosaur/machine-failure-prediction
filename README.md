# Machine Failure Prediction using Sensor Data

## 📝 Project Overview

This project analyzes manufacturing sensor data to predict machine failures. The goal is to identify potential failures proactively, enabling timely maintenance to reduce downtime and associated costs.

The analysis, including data preprocessing, model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost), and evaluation, is detailed in the `Predictive_Maintenance.ipynb` notebook.

## 📊 Dataset

The project uses the "Predictive Maintenance Dataset" which contains sensor readings and operational data.
